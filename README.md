Decided to fork the project. for the readme, I gutted his/hers of most of it's contents, and added my own lines:

# AquaHotkey-G

*Class Prototyping Library for AutoHotkey v2.*

A fork of Aqua for use in my own AnimaHotkey project.
Probably not going to be documenting this for a while if at all.
Mostly just small tweaks to make it more ergonomic for me.

If you want to use it, I'd recommend using the original over at [https://github.com/0w0Demonic/AquaHotkey](https://github.com/0w0Demonic/AquaHotkey) instead.
